## Python Instructions

A number of demonstrations will make use of the Jupyter Project (formerly
IPython Notebook) technology. For participants who wish to use Python during the
workshop, please follow the instructions below. To save time, we suggest
following these steps before your arrival at the workshop.

1. [Install Miniconda from Continuum Analytics](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)
2. Once Miniconda is installed, from the command prompt, run these instructions:

```
conda config --add channels [some channels]
conda create -n workshop python=2 pip numpy scipy matplotlib ipython-notebook pandas netcdf4 dask xray
```

If you have questions about these instructions, please contact
<mailto:support@unidata.ucar.edu>.

Once this software is in place, Unidata Users Workshop staff and presenters will
instruct participants how to make use of this software.
